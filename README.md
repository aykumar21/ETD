Electricity theft is a significant concern for utilities and power grids, resulting in substantial financial losses and overloading of grids, leading to potential grid failures and safety hazards for workers. To combat this issue, various practices and methods have been employed, including Manual Involvement, Hardware Detection, and Data-Driven methods. The Data-Driven Method is further categorized into fundamental and advanced approaches. This project delves into the limitations of fundamental data-driven methods (SVM, RF, LSTM, Decision Tree, etc.) and explores how these challenges can be efficiently, economically, and swiftly addressed using advanced approaches such as Deep Learning, CNN, Wide & Deep CNN, Time Series Forecasting, and Machine Learning.
